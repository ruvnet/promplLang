# PromptLang
PromptLang is a custom programming language specifically designed for use in GPT-4 prompts and AI interactions. With its simple and human-readable syntax, it is easy to integrate with various platforms, including APIs and data. The language includes built-in support for context management, error handling, a standard library, template support, modularity, AI-assisted code generation, the ability to disable explanations, explanations for errors, and optional multi-language output capabilities.

## Syntax Overview
* Functions are defined using the keyword define.
* Variables are declared with the keyword let.
* Conditional statements use if, else if, and else.
* Looping constructs include for and while.
* Comments are written with // for single-line comments and /* */ for multi-line comments.

## Features
Context management: Maintain the state of conversation or execution across multiple prompts, allowing for more interactive and dynamic exchanges with the AI model.
Error handling: A robust error-handling system that includes clear instructions on handling errors or unexpected inputs during AI model interactions.
Standard library: A built-in library of commonly used functions and utilities specifically tailored for prompt usage.
Template support: Define and manage templates for common prompt structures, making it easier to create and maintain complex prompts with minimal repetition or redundancy.

Modularity: Create and manage modular components within the language, allowing for code snippet or logic reuse across multiple prompts.
AI-assisted code generation: Built-in support for AI-assisted code generation, enabling AI models to generate or complete code snippets automatically.
Disable explanations: The ability to disable any explanations or additional text other than the response from the language.
Explanations for errors: Provide explanations for errors encountered during code execution.

## How to Initialize PromptLang
To start using PromptLang, copy and paste the following prompt into your conversation with ChatGPT

```text 
You are a custom programming language called PromptLang v0.0.1, specifically designed for use in prompts and AI interactions. It features a simple and human-readable syntax, making it easy to integrate with various platforms, including APIs and data. Functions are defined with 'define', variables are declared with 'let', conditional statements use 'if', 'else if', and 'else', loops use 'for' and 'while', and comments are written with '//' or '/* */'. PromptLang includes built-in support for context management, error handling, a standard library, template support, modularity, AI-assisted code generation, the ability to disable explanations, explanations for errors, and optional multi-language output capabilities.

Given the following PromptLang v0.0.1 code snippet:
define add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

define subtract(x, y) {
    return x - y;
}

define multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

define divide(x, y) {
    if (y != 0) {
        return x / y;
    } else {
        throw new Error("Error: Division by zero.");
    }
}

Please provide the corresponding output of the program (optional: in the desired output language, such as Python or JavaScript), taking into account the context management, error handling, and other features of the language. Additionally, only provide the response from the language without any explanations or additional text. 

Respond with “ PromptLang v0.0.1  initialized” to begin using this language.
```

```
define divide(x, y) {
    if (y != 0) {
        return x / y;
    } else {
        throw new Error("Error: Division by zero.");

### Regular Expression Example
In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use regular expressions in PromptLang for validating an email address. Note that PromptLang itself does not have built-in support for regular expressions. Instead, we'll use the AI-assisted code generation feature to generate the equivalent code in a language that supports regular expressions, like JavaScript or Python.
```
Please provide a function in JavaScript that takes an email address as input and returns true if it's valid, and false otherwise. The function should use regular expressions for validation.
```
#### Response
```
function isValidEmail(email) {
    const regex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
    return regex.test(email);
}
```
### Complex Math Example: Quadratic Equation Solver
In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use PromptLang to create a quadratic equation solver that finds the real roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
```
define quadratic_solver(a, b, c) {
    let delta = (b * b) - (4 * a * c);
    
    if (delta > 0) {
        let root1 = (-b + sqrt(delta)) / (2 * a);
        let root2 = (-b - sqrt(delta)) / (2 * a);
        return [root1, root2];
    } else if (delta == 0) {
        let root = -b / (2 * a);
        return [root];
    } else {
        return [];
    }
}

define main() {
    let a = 1;
    let b = -3;
    let c = 2;
    
    let roots = quadratic_solver(a, b, c);
    
    if (len(roots) == 2) {
        print("Two real roots: ", roots[0], " and ", roots[1]);
    } else if (len(roots) == 1) {
        print("One real root: ", roots[0]);
    } else {
        print("No real roots");
    }
}
```

    let sum = 0;
    let count = len(numbers);

    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }

    return sum / count;
}

define standard_deviation(numbers) {
    let avg = average(numbers);
    let count = len(numbers);

    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        let diff = numbers[i] - avg;
        variance_sum += diff * diff;
    }

    let variance = variance_sum / count;
    return sqrt(variance);
}

define main() {
    let data = [12, 15, 18, 22, 17, 14, 18, 23, 29, 12];

    let avg = average(data);
    let std_dev = standard_deviation(data);

    print("Average: ", avg);
    print("Standard Deviation: ", std_dev);
}

### Finance Example: Compound Interest Calculation
In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use PromptLang to calculate the future value of an investment based on compound interest.
```
define compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding_frequency) {
    let exponent = compounding_frequency * time;
    let base = 1 + (rate / compounding_frequency);
    
    return principal * pow(base, exponent);
}

define main() {
    let principal = 1000;        // Initial investment
    let annual_rate = 0.05;       // Annual interest rate (5%)
    let time_in_years = 10;       // Time period in years
    let compounding_frequency = 4; // Quarterly compounding (4 times a year)

    let future_value = compound_interest(principal, annual_rate, time_in_years, compounding_frequency);
    
    print("Future value of the investment: ", future_value);
}
```
#### Response
```
Future value of the investment: 1643.6194634877714
